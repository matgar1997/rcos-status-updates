## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This previous week I didnt get as much done as I wanted, since I had my first code review
> and since I was working on a small UI tweak their was a lot of debate over wether they liked
> it or prefered the old style

> I was also able to get my first auto graded hello world assignment on submitty

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan on fixing some of the broken links on submitty when submitty.org changed
> the website structure

> I also plan on creating a couple of easy intro assignments

## Anything Blocking?

> At the moment no, but I have a feeling the auto grading on submitty will have some problems
> when my tests become more advanced

## Notes

> I didnt get as much done this week as I was hoping since I was in california for an interview
