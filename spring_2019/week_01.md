## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week I was getting setup with submitty and I designed a homework for CS 1 based around \
> classes and objects. 

> The objective of the homework is to teach simple classes with private instance variables \
> constructors and toString methods.

> In addition to that they will need to do simple File IO in java.


## This Week's Plan

> I plan to fininalize this homework but doing finishing touches on the homework description pdf \
> as well as create an auto grader for the homework with a guide for instructions to to create a new \
> gradable on submitty

## Anything Blocking?

> I am waiting to upload my assignments to the github but the submitty repo doesnt have a place for me to push them \
> at the moment. Professor Cutler said she would do that part, though so it not really blocking.

## Notes

> None
