## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I pushed a PR for submitty to standardize the help links with font awesome
> I also worked on the class/object auto grader config files

> Doing this I learned about font awesome and gained more experiance with html


## This Week's Plan

> I plan to make a bunch of mini assignments for easier projects

> I also might try to take up more front end work, it depends \
what happens at the small group meetings with submitty

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to took back the the tutorials for submitty configs for running hidden tests

## Notes

> First time doing a PR for submitty was cool and I learned more about git/github
