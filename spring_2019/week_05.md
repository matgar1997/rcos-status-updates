## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I finished a bunch of smaller homeworks and the auto grader/config files for them.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan on starting a new page for submitty.org which will advertise the homeworks for people to use.
> But given my workload this week Im not sure how much is gonna get done.

## Anything Blocking?

> I dont know how difficult it is gonna be to create a page for submitty but I think they use markdown
so it shouldnt be that bad. I cant think of anything else

## Notes

> None
