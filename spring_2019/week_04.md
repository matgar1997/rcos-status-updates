## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I reverted back to the old style with the additional question mark links, as well as fixed some of the broken
> links. In addition to that I worked on adding more assignment for High school teachers to have ready to go.
> In addition to my first homework their is now a simple Hello World autograder setup, Madlibs program, fizzbuzz,
> and I am in the middle of my next large assignment which is all about putting code into seperate functions

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan on finishing the functions homework, testing the autograders I made prior on submitty to
> confirm they work and well as getting my PR for the links complete. I will have a lot more time over spring
> break.

## Anything Blocking?

> Not really a block in terms of how to do the PR, its more just trying to figure out what looks best
> and having everyone (or at least most) people on the team agree 

## Notes

> Giving my first PR was interesting. Im not surpised it was accepted right away but since my PR was more of
> a UI tweak everyone had really specific opinions about it and more often than not they conflicted so
> it can be hard trying to find the right balance
